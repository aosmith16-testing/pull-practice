# Practicing pull requests

Use this repo to have my other self practice pull requests.  It's good to practice what happens during pull requests from the point of view of both parties involved (the pullee and the puller).

Using package **usethis** makes pull requests easy for the person proposing the edits.  Otherwise there are several steps to keep track of.

A Git client like the RStudio Git pane or GitKraken can help make pull requests easier, particularly for beginners who aren't used to using the command line.
